# CryptoClustering

For this week's challenge we were provided crypto currency data and were tasked with using unsupervised machine learning concepts for our analysis. The two methods that were used for this analysis were KMeans and Principal Component Analysis. The resulting analysis for this project is provided within the comments in the jupyter notebook file within this repository. 

Data for this assignment was provided by EDX Bootcamps.
